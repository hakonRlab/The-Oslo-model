### **The Oslo model**

A lymph node invasion prediction model for prostate cancer patients

Sample size calculations. I have just been doing some testing.

```{r}
library(pmsampsize)
out <- pmsampsize(type = "b", cstatistic  = 0.8, parameters = 20, prevalence = 0.25, shrinkage = 0.8)
out$results_table

```
